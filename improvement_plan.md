# Performance and Code Quality Improvement Plan

## 1. Image Loading and Caching Optimizations

### Current Issues:
- Redundant image precaching checks
- No size-based image optimization
- Memory management could be improved

### Recommendations:
- Implement adaptive image loading based on device screen size
- Add image size optimization with proper caching headers
- Implement memory-sensitive cache eviction strategy
- Consider using compressed WebP format for all images

## 2. Map Rendering Performance

### Current Issues:
- Excessive rebuilds in RegionsLayer
- Redundant ValueListenableBuilder nesting
- No layer caching mechanism

### Recommendations:
- Implement proper layer caching with RepaintBoundary
- Consolidate ValueListenableBuilder usage
- Add custom equality comparison for polygons
- Implement selective repainting for hover effects

## 3. State Management Improvements

### Current Issues:
- Frequent notifyListeners calls in RegionManager
- Redundant state updates
- No separation between UI and business logic

### Recommendations:
- Implement granular state updates
- Add proper state immutability
- Consider using Riverpod or bloc pattern for better state management
- Separate business logic from UI components

## 4. Memory Optimization

### Current Issues:
- Large GeoJSON data kept in memory
- No cleanup of unused resources
- Potential memory leaks in image caching

### Recommendations:
- Implement lazy loading for GeoJSON data
- Add proper resource disposal
- Implement memory-efficient polygon storage
- Add cache size limits and cleanup mechanisms

## 5. Code Organization and Error Handling

### Current Issues:
- Mixed concerns in MapWidget
- Inconsistent error handling
- Debug prints scattered throughout code

### Recommendations:
- Separate map initialization logic
- Implement proper logging system
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Create dedicated error handling service

## 6. Interactive Features Optimization

### Current Issues:
- Complex hit detection logic
- Redundant hover state calculations
- Multiple event handlers for similar actions

### Recommendations:
- Optimize hit detection algorithm
- Consolidate interaction handlers
- Implement gesture arena for better touch handling
- Add interaction throttling

## Implementation Priority:

1. State Management Improvements
   - Highest impact on overall performance
   - Will make future improvements easier

2. Map Rendering Performance
   - Direct impact on user experience
   - Quick wins available

3. Memory Optimization
   - Critical for long-term app stability
   - Prevents performance degradation

4. Image Loading and Caching
   - Important for initial load experience
   - Can be implemented incrementally

5. Code Organization
   - Improves maintainability
   - Can be done gradually

6. Interactive Features
   - Quality of life improvements
   - Can be optimized after core improvements

## Next Steps:

1. Review and approve improvement plan
2. Create detailed implementation tasks
3. Prioritize quick wins
4. Set up monitoring for performance metrics
5. Implement changes iteratively
6. Measure impact of each change
